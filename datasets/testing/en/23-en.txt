Flueggea, the bushweeds, is a genus of shrubs and trees in the family Phyllanthaceae first described as a genus in 1806. It is widespread across much of Asia, Africa, and various oceanic islands, with a few species in South America in on the Iberian Peninsula.
The genus is named after John Fluegge, a German cryptogamic botanist.
Members of this genus all have entire ovate leaves and minute green flowers that form at the leaf axils in the form of fascicles or cymes. The fruits are berries, of the size of peas.
Many members of the genus were formerly classified under the genus Securinega.
